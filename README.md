2. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
3. Customize the configuration in `site.config.js`
4. To use the like button and hit counter, register for [Upstash Redis](https://console.upstash.com/redis) service, create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill in the following information:

   ```env
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL = xxx
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN = xxx
   ```

5. Run `npm run new:post filename title [tag1] [tag2] ...` to create a post in `posts` folder, for more syntax reference, see [example posts](https://www.xiaojun.im/posts/2023-04-27-mdx-syntax-guide)
